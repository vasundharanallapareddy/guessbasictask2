# guessbasictask2
The provided code implements a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 200, and the player has to guess it within six attempts.
the few improvements and corrections are:
1. Fixing the scope of the name variable so that it's accessible inside the pick function.
2. Simplifying the loop conditions for replaying the game.


Key improvements:
- The number variable is passed as a parameter to the pick function.
- Used f-strings for better readability.
- Improved the condition for replaying the game to be case-insensitive.
- Removed unnecessary comments and added better ones where needed.
